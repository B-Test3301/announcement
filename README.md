# 📢announcement
There are several changes I made to avoid the reports that are always filed by "L", I am concerned to see his identity leaked including full name, email, ID card, etc. It makes me quite sympathetic to "L", massive changes will be made starting from replacing the outdated AI Support with a newer one. That's all for today's announcement.🌞
